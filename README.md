# E-commerce Application (Under Development)

This is a full-stack E-commerce application built with Laravel, Vue.js, Tailwind.css, and Inertia.js. The application allows users to browse products, filter and sort them by brand and category, manage their cart, and proceed to checkout using Stripe payment integration. Additionally, there's an admin dashboard that provides insights into product status, sales, orders, and allows admin users to manage products and orders.

## Features


- **Product Management**: Admin users can create, delete, and update products. They can also add photos to products to provide visual representation to users.

- **User Authentication and Security**: The application ensures secure user authentication using Laravel's built-in authentication features. User passwords are hashed for security, and user sessions are managed securely.

- **Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard provides a centralized interface for managing products, categories, and orders. Admin users can view and edit product details, track product status (e.g., published, draft), view sales analytics, and manage customer orders.

- **Role-based Access Control**: The application implements role-based access control to restrict access to certain features and resources based on user roles. Admin users have access to the admin dashboard and product management features, while regular users can browse and shop for products.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
